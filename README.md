# TerryCompile

TerryCompile is a simple compiler tool for TerryLib games. To use it, just copy the App to the project folder you want to compile, run it, and click the compile button!

TerryCompile is part of a beginner's programming tutorial that I'm currently writing. It's intended to give beginners a simple way to get programs up and running without having to install an IDE.
